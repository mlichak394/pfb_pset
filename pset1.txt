PROBLEM SET

1. Log into your machine.
2. What is the full path to your home directory?
    
    ```bash
    /Users/madisonlichak
    ```
    
3. Go up one directory?
    
    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```
    
    - How many files does it contain?
    - How many directories?
4. Make a directory called `problemsets` in your home directory.
    
    ```bash
    cd Desktop
    mkdir cshl_PSETS
    ```
    
5. Navigate into this new directory called problemsets. Verify that you are in the correct directory by using `pwd`.
    
    ```bash
    cd cshl_PSETS
    pwd
    ```
    
6. Use `wget` to copy [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prog4biol/pfb2019/master/files/sequences.nt.fa](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prog4biol/pfb2019/master/files/sequences.nt.fa) from the web into your problemsets directory. If `wget` is not available on your system, use `curl -O` as an alternative. (Note '-O' is the letter O not the number Zero 0)
    
    ```bash
    curl -O [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prog4biol/pfb2019/master/files/sequences.nt.fa](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prog4biol/pfb2019/master/files/sequences.nt.fa)
    ```
    
7. Without using a text editor use unix commands to find these qualities for the file `sequences.nt.fa`. This file can be found here [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prog4biol/pfb2019/master/files/sequences.nt.fa](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prog4biol/pfb2019/master/files/sequences.nt.fa)
    - How many lines does this file contain?
        
        ```bash
        wc -l sequences.nt.fa
        ```
        
    - How many characters? (Hint: check out the options of wc)
        
        ```bash
        wc -c sequences.nt.fa
        ```
        
    - What is the first line of this file? (Hint: read the man page of head)
        
        ```bash
        head -n1 sequences.nt.fa
        ```
        
    - What are the last 3 lines? (Hint: read the man page of tail)
        
        ```bash
        tail -n 3 sequences.nt.fa
        ```
        
    - How many sequences are in the file? (Hint: use grep) (Note: The start of a sequence is indicated by a `>` character.)
        
        ```bash
        grep '>' sequences.nt.fa
        ```
        
8. Rename `sequences.nt.fa` to `cancer_genes.fasta`. (Hint: read the man page for mv)
    
    ```bash
    mv sequences.nt.fa cancer_genes.fasta
    ```
    
9. Copy this remote file, cuffdiff.txt, to your problemset directory. Here is the url you can use: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prog4biol/pfb2019/master/files/cuffdiff.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prog4biol/pfb2019/master/files/cuffdiff.txt)
    
    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prog4biol/pfb2019/master/files/cuffdiff.txt
    ```
    

Use `wget` to copy [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prog4biol/pfb2019/master/files/cuffdiff.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prog4biol/pfb2019/master/files/cuffdiff.txt) from the web into your problemsets directory. If `wget` is not available on your system, use `curl -O` as an alternative. (Note '-O' is the letter O not the number Zero 0)

1. Do the following to `cuffdiff.txt`. The descriptions of each column in the file are in the table below.
    - Look at the first few lines of the file
        
        ```bash
        head -n 5 cuffdiff.txt
        ```
        
    - Sort the file by log fold change 'log2(fold_change)', from highest to lowest, and save in a new file in your directory called sorted.cuffdiff.out
        
        ```bash
        sort -k 10gr cuffdiff.txt > sort_cuffdiff.txt
        ```
        
    - Sort the file (log fold change highest to lowest) then print out only the first 100 lines. Save in a file called `top100.sorted.cuffdiff.out`.
        
        ```bash
        head -n 100 sort_cuffdiff.txt > top100_sort_cuffdiff.txt
        wc -l top100_sort_cuffdiff.txt
        ```
        
    - Sort the file by log fold change, print out the top 100, print only first column. This will be a list of the top 100 genes with the largest change in expression. Make sure your list is sorted by gene name and is unique. Save this curated list in a file called `differentially.expressed.genes.txt`.
